                            Individuals should always review and, if necessary, adjust their privacy settings on

                            will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal

                            also be able to see which of your friends are playing the same game and their progress
                            through the games (and they will be able to see you and your progress) or access other

                            friends to play. You can choose not to allow us to access your email address in the

                            Pine Games profile.
                            Logging in with Facebook will not allow us to post anything to your page without your
                            permission, and we will not receive any information about your Facebook friends who do
                            not play our games. If you do not wish your Facebook friends to be able to see you and
                            your progression in our games, you can prevent this by disconnecting from Facebook from
                            our games and updating your app permissions from within your Facebook settings. If you
                            choose not to create a Pine Games profile by connecting your Facebook account, the
                            personal data that we collect when you play our games will be linked to a random
                            identifier rather than information that could identify you directly, but we will collect
                            device-level identifiers and other information associated with those identifiers
                            described above.
                            ⦁ We recommend that you read Facebook's Privacy Policy and review your privacy settings
                            from time to time to ensure that you understand fully how your Facebook data is shared.

                    <h6>THIRD-PARTY DATA COLLECTION AND ONLINE ADVERTISING</h6>
                    <p>We participate in interest-based advertising and use third-party advertising companies to
                        serve targeted advertisements based on your browsing history. We permit third-party online
                        advertising networks, social media companies and other third-party services to collect
                        information about your use of our online services over time so that they may play or display
                        ads on our Services, on other websites or services you may use, and on other devices, you
                        may use.

                        Our advertising partners may help us serve ads to you by combining your personal data with
                        data they have collected about you elsewhere. They collect this information when you use
                        their services or the websites and services of third parties. Our partners use this
                        information to make assumptions about the kinds of advertising you would prefer to see. If
                        they determine that you would be interested in seeing an advert for Pine Games' Services,
                        they will serve you with a Pine Games advertising while using other websites and services.
                        We use ad identifiers and similar technologies to provide our Services to you and in order
                        to collect data from your device. These technologies allow our third-party advertising
                        partners and us to:

                        <li>
                            recognize you and your device;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            provide interest-based advertising to you;

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            allow our Services to interact with a third-party social network or platform (where you
                            have chosen to allow such interaction);
                        </li>

                            to provide our Services in the correct language.

                    </ul>
                    Typically, though not always, the information used for interest-based advertising is collected
                    through tracking technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts,
                    location-identifying technologies, and similar technology, which recognize the device you are
                    using and collect information, including click stream information, browser type, time and date
                    you visited the Sites, AdID, precise location data and other information. We may share a common
                    account identifier (such as a hashed email address or user ID) with our third-party advertising
                    partners to help identify you across devices.
                    <br>
                    Our third-party partners and we may use this information to make the advertisements you see
                    online more relevant to your interests and provide advertising-related services such as
                    reporting, attribution, analytics and market research. We may also use services provided by
                    third parties (such as social media platforms) to serve targeted ads to you and others on such
                    platforms. We may do this by providing a hashed version of your email address or other
                    information to the platform provider.

                    <h6>INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER</h6>
                    <p>All personal data collected or stored by Pine Games may be stored anywhere in the world,
                        including, but not limited to, the Republic of Turkey, the United States, and the European
                        Union. When we transfer your personal data internationally, we will take reasonable steps to
                        ensure that it is treated securely, lawfully, and in the manner, we describe here. Please
                        note that laws vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, so the privacy laws applicable to the
                        places where your personal is transferred to or stored, used or processed may be different
                        from the privacy laws applicable to the place where you are resident and may not provide the
                        same level of protection for personal data as the country from which it was transferred.
                        <br>

                        We may transfer personal data about you outside of Europe. When we do so, we rely on
                        appropriate or suitable safeguards recognized under applicable law, including adequacy
                        decisions and standard contractual clauses.
                        <br>
                        If you are using our Services from the European Union or other regions with laws governing
                        data collection and use, please note that by providing your personal data to us, you consent
                        to process your personal data in the above-mentioned locations.
                        <br>
                        By choosing to visit the Services or otherwise provide information to us, you agree that any
                        dispute over privacy or the terms contained in this Privacy Policy will be governed by the
                        laws of the Republic of Turkey and the adjudication of any disputes arising in connection
                        with our Services will be in accordance with the terms of Pine Games Terms of Service.

                        facilities and protected by protocols and procedures such as firewalls and data encryption
